Bumblebee is an interoperability library for Microsoft Excel and Grasshopper, focusing on not just data transfer but graphic control and MS Office object creation.

The goal of Bumblebee is to create a series of components that allow for variable levels of engagement with Excel, from simply transferring a large set of data between the programs at high speeds, to creating graphically coordinated charts and data sets.

_Bumblebee 3 is a single GHA library that takes advantage of the MS Office COM object for faster and more robust functionality._
